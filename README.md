- 👋 Hi, I’m @GabeG13
- 👀 I’m interested in learning from others. I recently started teaching myself how to code Python and have been loving the journey! While I have always been interested in learning to code, I was unfortunately discouraged as a teenager from pursuing it as a career path. A small, minded school “guidance” counselor told me the field was saturated back in the early 2000’s. Now in my late 30’s I am finally established enough in my career and life to focus my energy on coding and creating cool projects for fun and to automate some of my day job :)  

- 💞️ I’m always looking to collaborate on on fun projects that will help me build up my expereince and protfolio. I plan on creating a personal website in the next few months to track and share my progress!!! Come back and check it out!!!
- 📫 How to reach me (Coming soon)
